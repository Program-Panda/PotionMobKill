## Description
The plugin is designed to add potion effects to mob kills when a player kills a entity. The ops (permsion node can be given) can set what potion effects are given on the death of any entity they want and can add multiple potion effects (each with there own time duration and likelhood) to each entity death trigger. The plugin allows the op to set these through the config, however, commands are provided to allow the user to set these values from inside the game whilst auto updating the config.
